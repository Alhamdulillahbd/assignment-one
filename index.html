            <p>Forest is the lung of the Mother Earth. Without forest it’s impossible to live in the world. That’s mean
                no forest no life. The word “forest” comes from old French word forest (also fores). And the Bans word
                derives from the English Word Forest. The first known forests on Earth arose in the Late Devonian
                (approximately 380 million years ago), with the evolution of Archaeopteryx.</p>

                    <p>I am currently learning the work of a web developer. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and git.
                        It
                        takes a lot of hard work to learn the work of a web developer. Everyone will pray that I can be
                        successful. Thanks</p>
